           DBus Installation
           =================

Quick start
===========

This branch of dbus can be built by using Meson, GNU Autotools or CMake.
The Meson build system is the recommended build system for the master
branch (versions >= 1.15.0).

Meson only supports out-of-tree builds, and must be passed a directory to put
built and generated sources into. We'll call that directory "build" here. It's
recommended to create a separate build directory for each configuration you
might want to use.

Basic configuration is done with:

``` sh
meson build/
```

This will create the build directory. If any dependencies are missing, you can
install them, or try to remove the dependency with a Meson configuration option
(see below).

Older versions of dbus required Autotools or CMake, with Autotools
recommended for Unix systems and CMake recommended for Windows systems.

Configuration flags
===================

When using Meson, to review the options which Meson chose, run:

``` sh
meson configure build/
```

With additional arguments meson configure can be used to change options for a
previously configured build directory. All options passed to this command are in
the form `-D "option"="value"`. For example:

``` sh
meson configure build/ -Dprefix=/tmp/install
```

See `meson_options.txt` for details of dbus-specific options, and
<https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html> for details of generic
Meson options.

When using Autotools, run "./configure --help" to see the possible
configuration options and environment variables.

When using CMake, inspect README.cmake to see the possible
configuration options and environment variables.

Building
========

To build with meson, here is a quick guide:

``` sh
cd dbus
meson setup build/ && cd build/
meson compile
meson test
```

Full build instructions can be found on mesonbuild website:
https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html

The CMake equivalent is:

    mkdir dbus-build-dir
    cd dbus-build-dir
    cmake -G <makefile-generator-name> [-D<option>] <dbus-src-root>/cmake
    make
    make install

See README.cmake for more details.

External software dependancies
==============================

The only fundamental requirement to build DBus is an XML parser,
however, there are a number of other software packages which (if
present) will enhance functionality.

Core library
------------

 Requisite:

  - Gettext
  - expat

 Optional:

  - libselinux           (for SELinux integration)
  - doxygen              (for API documentation)
  - xmlto or meinproc4   (for Spec & other XML documentation)
